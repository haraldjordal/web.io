        <h2>About Iannis Xenakis</h2>
        <p>
            Iannis Xenakis (1922-2001) was a Greek-French composer, music theorist, and architect-engineer. He is considered one of the most important post-World War II composers. Xenakis's music is highly distinctive, combining elements of modernism, mathematics, and ancient Greek influences. His pioneering work in the application of mathematical models to music composition has left a lasting legacy on contemporary music.

            Xenakis studied engineering in Greece before moving to France in 1947, where he worked with the renowned architect Le Corbusier. His background in engineering and architecture heavily influenced his musical compositions, particularly his use of mathematical concepts such as stochastic processes, set theory, and game theory. Some of his most famous works include "Metastaseis" (1953-54), "Pithoprakta" (1955-56), and "Persephassa" (1969). Xenakis also developed the UPIC system, a computer-based tool for composing music graphically.
